The Rediculous License, Version 1

The existence of this License is, in essence, a recursive logical joke. It holds no actual legal authority, and its sole purpose is to add a gratuitous layer of meta-humor to the world of open-source software. By employing this License, You agree to temporarily suspend your sanity (at least in matters of legal governance).

· "Amusement": shall mean a physiological or psychological response, including but not limited to: the curling of the corners of the mouth, increased nasal exhalation, the vocalization "ha-ha," the slapping of one's knee, or the internal acknowledgment of the inherent absurdity of this text, potentially manifesting as an eye-roll.
